# My First Tkinter App
Written in Python3.10
I created a virtual environment (very easy, used a Freecodecamp article to set it up).

All this app does is present the user with a button that when initially clicked changes the text label beneath it, and then updates the number of times the user clicked the button.

Pretty easy.
